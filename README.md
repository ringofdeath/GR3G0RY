This is a Operating System github I decided to use for updates for anyone from my school's Personal Project showcase , and also for users who would like to use my OS. This is a huge work in progress for me I hope to get something simalr to linux and windows. I want to be able to share my work with other's so I believe the term is open source.
 This Operating System will be upload as soon as I feel ready and don't worry I don't like abandoning projects that I have other people hoping for so you will see soemthing I promise and holy shit my moniter is so dirty.
